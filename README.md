Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)
Create a program that prompts the user to input student marks, The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade: 
A > 79
B - 60 to 79

E - less 40.

Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)
Create a program that takes the speed of a car for example 80km/s. If the speed is less than 70km/s, it should print "ok". Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70km/s), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.
